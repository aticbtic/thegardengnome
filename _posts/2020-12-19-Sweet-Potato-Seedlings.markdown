<h2>Seedlings</h2>
<p> 2020 was my first year of starting sweet potato seedlings.  I bought a few organic sweet potatoes from the store.  Organic so that they sweet potatoes are not treated with chemicals that may prevent growth of seedlings.  I don't know that is the case but just to be sure since I'm putting effort into it. I started the seedling in late February, 2020.
