<h2>Seedlings</h2>
<p> 2020 was my first year of starting sweet potato seedlings.  I bought a few organic sweet potatoes from the store.  Organic, so that they sweet potatoes are not treated with chemicals that may prevent growth of seedlings.  I don't know that is the case, but just to be sure since I'm putting effort into it. I started the seedling in late February, 2020.

The first lesson that I learned this first round is that I need to start the potato seedlins earlier in water as it takes several months to get a seedling big enough to plant in the yard.  The seedlings need to be at least a foot tall. In Oregon, starting the sweet potato in water in January seems more appropriate.

The second thing that I learned is that sweet potatoes grows tubers horizontally in the soil,  so growing in a pot gives me only a small harvest.  I had a later batch that I grew in a raised bed and those seem to do better.
