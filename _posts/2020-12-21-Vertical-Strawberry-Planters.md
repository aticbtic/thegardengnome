For the past few years, we've had strawberries in the backyard but we've never had a harvest.  They are often eaten by slugs and other critters.  This coming year (2021),  I'm going to try and create a vertical planter to get the strawberries off the ground.  

This morning, I bought a couple of four foot pipes from Home Depot.  I have an idea on what I'd like to create in order to hang planting bags on them.

Ok, the four foot conduit pipes used for sprinkler system was a bit too flexible.  I replaced those with 3/4 inch PVC pipes.  

### Items used:
- 2x 6 ft PVC 3/4" pipes
- A couple of 3/4" straps
- Screws
- 1x Wood (2 x 4)
- 1x Wood Post (4 x 4)
- 1x 6 pocket hanging planting bag

## Step 1:  
Drill 3/4 inch hole on the post about 1/4 inch deep.  This hole is to fit one end of the PVC pipe.  This allows the pipes to be removable.

## Step 3:  
Use a level to make sure the pipe is level before screwing in the strap. Make sure to have the pipe in the strap prior to screwing it in.
