For the past few years, we've had strawberries in the backyard but we've never had a harvest.  They are often eaten by slugs and other critters.  This coming year (2021),  I'm going to try and create a vertical planter to get the strawberries off the ground.  

This morning, I bought a couple of four foot pipes from Home Depot.  I have an idea on what I'd like to create in order to hang planting bags on them.
